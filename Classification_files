There are four sets, from:
1 neural network ensemble and monash agb final surface abundances (nn_*_monash_*)
2 nearest neighbour and monash agb final surface abundances (closest_*_monash_*)
3 neural network ensemble and fruity agb final surface abundances (nn_*_fruity_*)
4 nearest neighbour and fruity agb final surface abundances (closest_*_fruity_*)
